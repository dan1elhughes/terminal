# zshconfig

Basic installer for my zsh aliases and functions.

## Usage

- Install oh-my-zsh.
- Create any single-machine things in `./config/local.zsh`.
- Run `./install.sh` to copy the files into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom`.
- Close and reopen your terminal.

_Note that this is a dumb installer - back up existing files first_
